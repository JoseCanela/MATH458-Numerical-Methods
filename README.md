# Final Project - Optimization
## Overview
For our final project for our Numerical Methods class, we were given several different topics - each having their own project prompt. We chose **Optimization**.
*The final project consisted of **three problems*** - each having multiple parts. **Our professor mandated that our project code was written in MATLAB**. 

1. Consider the linear programming problem: 

      *minimize* x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> + 3x<sub>3</sub> 

      *subject to* x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub> + x<sub>3</sub> = 1; x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub> >= 0
       
      (a) Draw a diagram that illustrates the geometry of the problem.
       
      (B) Write a computer program that implements the *simplex method* to solve this problem.
       
      (c) Write a computer program that implements an *interior point* to solve this problem. **We used the *affine scaling method***.
          

2. Use Lagrange Multiplier Theory to find the portfolio that minimizes the variance (subject to contraints) in order to achieve a given level of mean return. We also observe how the solution varies with changes in *m*, the given level of mean return.
   * Look at the **Introduction** section of our project paper to see the details of the optimization problem.

3. Choose a 500 x 500 positive definite matrix **Q** and a 500 x 1 vector ***b***. Using the *conjugate
directions method* get a good approximation to the solution of the system **Q*****x*** = ***b***. Also, use the *Gauss elimination method* to solve this system. Compare the results and
comment on the advantages and disadvantages of each method.
